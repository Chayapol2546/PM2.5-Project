# PM2.5-Project
At present, our world has a climate that changes frequently and warped very easily. In 
addition, these weather conditions also have a significant impact on our daily lives, such as 
transportation, activities, and health matters. The problem that is currently very current is the 
PM 2.5 air pollution by the project this is provided to help you easily know the amount of 
dust around us. By submitting values including Date/Month/Year, Time, Air Quality, 
Location, and GPS. When the sensor is measured, all this information is sent to the line or on 
the location website. Data can be viewed through the Line app or through a website, where 
data transmission relies on Wi-Fi as an intermediary to transfer data, which is real-time data 
to a preset program. In addition, the device is small and portable, perfect for carrying around 
to know what the values are, allowing you to protect yourself or avoid going to that area.
